## Following Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks and Micrograd Tutorial 

## Video: [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)

I followed the video roughly till 1:43:54

Andrej's explanation and approach to concepts is always pretty amazing. 

This tutorial was very intuitive and worth going through if you know about neural networks and want to learn how backpropagation works in detail and how it's implemented.

I'll follow the rest of the tutorial to build MLP library using micrograd, maybe even try with numpy ***some other time :)***
